# WIDGETS

In order to minimize merge coflicts we will organize different world elements into widgets. Each widget will have their own folder and you will test the widget functinality in a test scene in each widget's folder. 

The master scene will refrence these widgets via a prefab for each widget making it such that you will not need to touch the main scene to change the widets.
